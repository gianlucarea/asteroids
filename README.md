# 🚀 Asteroids

A simple 2D space shooter inspired by the classic arcade game **Asteroids**.  
Built as a fun project to explore game loops, collision detection, movement physics, and object-oriented design.

## 🎮 Gameplay

You control a spaceship drifting through space while asteroids spawn and move across the screen.

Your objective:
- Avoid collisions
- Destroy asteroids
- Survive as long as possible

The game focuses on:
- Smooth player movement
- Projectile shooting
- Asteroid spawning and splitting
- Collision detection
- Real-time game loop mechanics

## 🧠 How It Works

The project demonstrates:

- A real-time game loop
- Object-oriented design patterns
- Sprite management
- Collision detection
- Screen rendering
- Event handling

It serves as a strong foundation for expanding into more advanced 2D game development.

# 🚀 Next Updates – Extending the Project

The base version is complete, but here are the **planned improvements and future updates** to expand the game:

## 🎯 Gameplay Enhancements
- Add a scoring system
- Implement multiple lives and respawning
- Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
- Add acceleration to the player movement
- Make objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing

## 🎨 Visual Improvements
- Add a background image
- Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
- Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one

## 🔫 Weapons & Power-Ups
- Create different weapon types
- Add a shield power-up
- Add a speed power-up
- Add bombs that can be dropped

## 📈 Future Vision

The long-term goal is to evolve this project into a polished arcade-style experience with:

- Sound effects
- Particle systems
- Difficulty scaling
- Enemy variations
- High score tracking
